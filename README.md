Project title: ShoppingCart

Even more and more focus on useReducer.

Description:
On the top of the page you can see three products, each with a "Add to Cart" button. These buttons will add the clicked product to the "Cart" and also update the count of items inside the cart.
Additionally you will have the option for each added product to remove it from the cart.

Better experience (for future)
- clear items inside cart
- update the total price inside cart
